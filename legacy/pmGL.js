	Commentary: prototype methods and pipeline factories
	
	The PhotoMap library allows for complete control of the image-to-PhotoMap pipeline with 2 methods:
	-Using the PhotoMap object and its properties
	-Using the pipeline factories
	
	The PhotoMap Objects themselves inherit from a prototype (define below)
	The prototype contains public methods for each step in the process of making a PhotoMap.
	By default, each of these are to be run separately, unless bubbling is set to true.
	When bubbling is enabled as true, the next method in the pipeline is immediately invoked.
	*It is good to take note that the pipeline factories do not have the option to bubble,
	because they are not attached to a PhotoMap object
	
	These prototype methods include:
	
	- staging:
	This process is dedicated to ripping source data off of an image and supplying it to the source property of the PhotoMap object.
	*Once, staging is complete within a PhotoMap, plotting is immediately invoked. See explanation below the "prototype staging method" label
	
	- plotting:
	From the data extracted during staging, a collection of coordinates for the main vertices of the PhotoMap object are calculated
	
	- framing:
	From the plot made in the previouse process, a collection of triangles and their vertices is formulated
	
	- drawing:
	The frame or collection of trinagles is then drawn in a WebGL canvas
	
	Each of these methods do at least 2 things:
	-return an object created by a *pipeline factory*
	-get the current relevant object from within the PhotoMapDrawing
	
	The pipeline factories do everything the object methods are supposed to (i.e. all those things listed above),
	but they are exposed factories and not object methods, which means they operate on I/O rather than modifying PhotoMaps
	
	Label: prototype methods
	
	Label: prototype staging method
	
	Commentary: Immediate plot invokation and optional callback for staging
	
	The point of the PhotoMap Object is to eventually construct a PhotoMap.
	With that said, if pipeline control is not required, the plotting function should be invoked immediately,
	especially since staging is offered as a pipeline factory
	
	However, if additional object control or a delay is required a callback is setup.
	This callback is defaulted to a function that will immediately invoke plotting
	
	*It is important to note that this control is intended for delay, and not termination in fully constructing a PhotoMap plot.
	If you do not wish to construct one, please use the pipeline factory instead
	*This callback option is not available for direct construction
	
	WIP - consideration of adding this callback function
